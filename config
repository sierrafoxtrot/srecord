 * the start of each.  You should also note that the strings are always
 * handed to the Bourne shell to be executed, and are set to exit with
 * an error immediately a sub-command fails.
 *
 * In these commands, the RCS file is kept unlocked, since only the owner will
 * be checking changes in.  The RCS functionality for coordinating shared
 * access is not required.
 *
 * One advantage of using RCS version 5.6 or later is that binary files are
