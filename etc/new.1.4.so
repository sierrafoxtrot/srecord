.\" Change 15
There is a new \fIbyte swap\fP input filter, allowing pairs of odd and
even input bytes to be swapped.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 14
The ``wilson'' file format is now understood for reading and writing.
This mystery format was added for a mysterious type of EPROM writer.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 13
The \fIsrec_cat\fP program now has a \fB-data-only\fP option, which
supresses all output except for the data records.  This helps when
talking to brain-dead EPROM programmers which barf at anything but data.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 12
There is a new \fI-Line-Length\fP option for the \fIsrec_cat\fP program,
allowing you to specify the maximum width of output lines.
