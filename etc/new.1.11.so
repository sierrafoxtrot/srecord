It is now possible to put \fB\-minimum\fP \fIinput.spec\fP (also
\fB\-maximum\fP and \fB\-length\fP) almost anywhere on the command line
that you can put a number.  It allows, for example, the \-offset value
to be calculated from the maximum of the previous file.
The values calculated by \fB\-Minimum\fP, \fB\-Maximum\fP and
\fB\-Length\fP may also be rounded to arbitrary boundaries, using
\fB\-Round_Down\fP, \fB\-Round_Nearest\fP and \fB\-Round_Up\fP.
