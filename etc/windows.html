The <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> tools are
ports of the popular GNU development tools and utilities for Windows 95,
98, and NT.  They function by using the Cygwin library which provides
a UNIX-like API on top of the Win32 API.
<p>
This means that you can compile SRecord for Windows 95, 98 and NT.
SRecord was tested on Windows NT in this way.  Other tools, such as
<a href="http://www.scl.com/products/mks/datasheets/nutcracker.html">
Nutcracker</a>, have not been confirmed.
<p>
<a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/">DJGPP</a> is a complete 32-bit
C/C++ development system for Intel 80386 (and higher) PCs running DOS.
It includes ports of many GNU development utilities.
<p>
Once you have <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> or <a
href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/">DJGPP</a> installed, simply follow
the instructions in the BUILDING file, as if it were Unix.
<p>
<b>Note:</b>
Some problems have been reported using GCC 3.2.
If you experience problems, please try GCC 2.96 instead.
Of course, a patch to fix the 3.2 problems is always welcome.
