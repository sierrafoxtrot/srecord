.SH NAME
srec_vhdl_textio \- file-format readable by vhdl textio.read functions.
.if require_index \{
.XX "srec_vhdl_textio(5)" "Xilinx Coefficient File Format"
.\}
.SH DESCRIPTION
This format is used by VHDL IEEE Std 1076 tools implementing the textio package functions.
They can be used in synthesis (to initialize memories) or simulations (to read stimuli).

The intended type is bit_vector, which means the lines generated by SRecord can be read with
the procedures \[lq]procedure READ (L: inout LINE; VALUE: out BIT_VECTOR; GOOD: out BOOLEAN);\[rq]. or
\[lq]procedure READ (L: inout LINE; VALUE: out BIT_VECTOR);\[rq].
This file-format contains no addressing and no comments.

Two optional arguments configure the number of bits consumed from the input and the number of
bits written into the output file. Default is 8 for each.
The number of bits consumed must be a multiple of 8.
It is not allowed to generate more bits than consumed.

.SH EXAMPLE
An example of the file looks like the following:
.RS
.nf
.ft CW
10010101
01101011
.ft P
