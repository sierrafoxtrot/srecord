.SH NAME
srec_vhdl_textio \- file-format readable by vhdl textio.read functions.
.SH DESCRIPTION
This format is used by VHDL IEEE Std 1076 tools implementing the textio
package functions. They can be used in synthesis (to initialize memories) or
simulations (to read stimuli).

The intended type is bit_vector, which means the lines generated by SRecord can
be read with the procedures \[lq]procedure READ (L: inout LINE;
VALUE: out BIT_VECTOR; GOOD: out BOOLEAN);\[rq] or
\[lq]procedure READ (L: inout LINE; VALUE: out BIT_VECTOR);\[rq].
These procedures are available after \[lq]use std.textio.all;\[rq].

This file-format contains no addressing and no comments.

.SH EXAMPLE
An example of the file looks like the following - it contains the
data \[lq]Hello, World\[rq].
