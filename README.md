# SRecord

The SRecord package is a collection of powerful tools for manipulating EPROM load files.

> I wrote SRecord because when I was looking for programs to manipulate EPROM load files, I could not find very many.
> The ones that I could find only did a few of the things I needed. SRecord is written in C++ and polymorphism is
> used to provide the file format flexibility and arbitrary filter chaining. Adding more file formats and filters is
> relatively simple, see the Reference Manual.
