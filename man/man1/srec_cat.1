.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I \*(n)
program is used to assemble the given input files into a single output
file.
The use of filters (see below) allows significant manipulations to be
performed by this command.
.SS Data Order
The data from the input files is not immediately written to the output,
but is stored in memory until the complete EPROM image has been
assembled.  Data is then written to the output file in ascending address
order.  The original ordering of the data (in those formats capable of
random record ordering) is \f[I]not\fP preserved.
.SS Data Comparison
Because input record order is not preserved, textual comparison of input
and output (such as the \f[I]diff\fP(1) or \f[I]tkdiff\fP(1) commands)
can be misleading.
Not only can lines appear in different address orders, but line lengths
and line termination can differ as well.
Use the \f[I]srec_cmp\fP(1) program to compare two EPROM load files.
If a text comparison is essential, run both files through the
\f[I]srec_cat\fP(1) program to ensure both files to be compared have
identical record ordering and line lengths.
.SS Data Conflicts
The storing of data in memory enables the detection of data conflicts,
typically caused by linker sections unintentionally overlapping.
.TP 2n
\[bu]
A warning will be issued for each address which is redundantly set to the
same value.
.TP 2n
\[bu]
A fatal error will be issued if any address is set with
contradictory values.
To avoid this error use an \fB\-exclude \-within\fP filter
(see \f[I]srec_input\fP(1)) or, to make it a warning, use the
\fB\-multiple\fP option (see below).
.TP 2n
\[bu]
A warning will be issued for input files where the data records are not
in strictly ascending address order.  To suppress this warning, use the
\fB\-disable-sequence-warning\fP option (see below).
.PP
These features are designed to detect problems which are difficult to
debug, and detects them \f[I]before\fP the data is written to an EPROM
and run in your embedded system.

.SH OPTIONS
The following options are understood:
.so man/man1/o_at.so
.TP 8n
\fB\-Output\fP \f[I]filename\fP [ \f[I]format\fP ]
.RS
This option may be used to specify the output file to be used.
The special file name ``\-'' is understood to mean the standard output.
Output defaults to the standard output if this option is not used.
.PP
The \f[I]format\fP may be specified as:
.TP 8n
\fB\-Absolute_Object_Module_Format\fP
An Intel Absolute Object Module Format file will be written.
(See
.IR srec_aomf (5)
for a description of this file format.)
.TP 8n
\fB\-Ascii_Hex\fP
An Ascii-Hex file will be written.
(See
.IR srec_ascii_hex (5)
for a description of this file format.)
.TP 8n
\fB\-ASM\fP [ \f[I]prefix\fP ][ \-\f[I]option\fP... ]
.RS
A series of assembler DB statements will be written.
.PP
The optional \f[I]prefix\fP may be specified to change the names of the
symbols generated.  The defaults to "\f[CW]eprom\fP" if not set.
.PP
Several options are available to modify the style of output:
.TP 8n
\fB\-Dot_STyle\fP
Use "dot" style pseudo-ops instead of words.
For example \f[CW].byte\fP instead of the \f[CW]DB\fP default.
.TP 8n
\fB\-HEXadecimal_STyle\fP
Use hexadecimal numbers in the output,
rather than the default decimal numbers.
.TP 8n
\fB\-Section_STyle\fP
By default the generated assemble of placed at the correct address using
\f[CW]ORG\fP pseudo-ops.  Section style output emits tables of section
addresses and lengths, so the data may be related at runtime.
.TP 8n
\fB\-A430\fP
Generate output which is compliant to the \f[CW]a430.exe\fP compiler as
it is used, \f[I]e.g.\fP in IAR Embedded Workbench.
This is short-hand for \-section-style \-hex-style
.TP 8n
\fB\-CL430\fP
Generate  output which is Code Composer Essentials compliant,
\f[I]i.e.\fP the compiler of it.
This is short-hand for \-section-style \-hex-style \-dot-style
.TP 8n
\fB\-Output_Word\fP
Generate output which is in two-byte words rather than bytes.  This
assumes little-endian words; you will need to use the \-Byte-Swap filter
if your target is big-endian.
No attempt is made to align the words onto even address boundaries;
use and input filter such as
.nf
.in +8n
\f[I]input-file\fP \-fill 0xFF -within \f[I]input-file\fP -range-pad 2
.in -8n
.fi
to pad the data to whole words first.

.TP 8n
\fB\-C_COMpressed\fP
These options ask for an compressed c-array whose memory
gaps will not be filled.
.TP 8n
\fB\-Output_Word\fP
This option asks for an output which is in words not in
bytes.  This is little endian, so you may need to
A Formatted Binary format file will be written.

This option says to use the EMON52 format file when writing the file.
(See
.IR srec_emon52 (5)
for a description of this file format.)
.TP 8n

This option says to use the Fairchild Fairbug format file when writing the file.
(See \f[I]srec_fairchild\fP(5) for a description of this file format.)
.TP 8n
\fB\-Fast_Load\fP
This option says to use the LSI Logic Fast Load format file when writing
the file.
(See \f[I]srec_fastload\fP(5) for a description of this file format.)
.TP 8n
\fB\-Formatted_Binary\fP
A Formatted Binary format file will be written.
(See \f[I]srec_formatted_binary\fP(5) for a description of this file format.)
.TP 8n

\fB\-HEX_Dump
A human readable hexadecimal dump (including ASCII)
will be printed.
.TP 8n
\fB\-Intel\fP
An Intel hex format file will be written.
(See
.IR srec_intel (5)

if you want 16-bit extended segment addressing
use the \fB\-address-length=2\fP option.
.TP 8n
\fB\-MOS_Technologies\fP
An Mos Technologies format file will be written.
(See
.IR srec_mos_tech (5)
for a description of this file format.)
.TP 8n
\fB\-Motorola\fP [ \f[I]width\fP ]
.RS
A Motorola S-Record file will be written.
(See
.IR srec_motorola (5)
for a description of this file format.)
This is the default output format.
By default, the smallest possible address length is emitted,
this will be S19 for data in the first 64KB;
if you wish to force S28 use the \fB\-address-length=3\fP option;
if you wish to force S37 use the \fB\-address-length=4\fP option
.PP
The optional \f[I]width\fP argument describes the number of bytes which
form each address multiple.  For normal uses the default of one (1) byte
is appropriate.  Some systems with 16-bit or 32-bit targets mutilate the
addresses in the file; this option will imitate that behavior.
Unlike most other parameters, this one cannot be guessed.
.RE
.TP 8n
\fB\-Needham_Hexadecimal\fP
This option says to use the Needham Electronics ASCII file format to
write the file.  See \f[I]srec_needham\fP(5) for a description of this
file format.

A VHDL format file will be written.
The \f[I]bytes-per-word\fP defaults to one,
the \f[I]name\fP defaults to \f[CW]eprom\fP.
The \f[I]etc/x_defs_pack.vhd\fP file in the source distribution contains an
example ROM definitions pack for the type-independent output.
You may need to use the \-byte-swap filter to get the byte order you want.
.TP 8n
\fB\-VMem\fP [ \f[I]memory-width\fP ]
A Verilog VMEM format file will be written.
The \f[I]memory-width\fP may be 8, 16, 32, 64 or 128 bits;
.\"
.\" The default number of bits is 32.
.\" If you change this, you must also change the following files:
.\"     lib/srec/arglex_output.cc
.\"     lib/srec/output/file/vmem.cc

A wilson format file will be written.
(See
.IR srec_wilson (5)
for a description of this file format.)
.RE
.TP 8n
\fB\-Address_Length\fP \f[I]number\fP
This option many be used to specify the minimum number of bytes to be
used in the output to represent an address (padding with leading zeros
if necessary).
This helps when talking to imbecilic EPROM programmer devices which do not
fully implement the format specification.
.TP 8n
.B \-Data_Only
This option implies the \fB\-disable=header\fP,
\fB\-disable=data-count\fP, \fB\-disable=exec-start-address\fP and
\fB\-disable=footer\fP options.
.TP 8n
.B \-ENable\fP \f[I]feature-name\fP
.RS
This option is used to enable the output of a named feature.
.TP 8n
Header
This feature controls the presence of header records, records which
appear before the data itself.
Headers often, but not always, include descriptive text.
.TP 8n
Data_Count
This feature controls the presence of data record count records, which
appear aftre the data, and state how many data records preceeded them.
Usually a data intergrity mechanism.
.TP 8n
Execution_Start_Address
The feature controls the presence of execution start address records,
which is where the monitor will jump to and start executing code once
the hex file has finished loading.
.TP 8n
Footer
This feature controls the presence of a file termination record,
one that \f[I]does not\fP double as an execution start address record.
.PP
Not all formats have all of the above features.
Not all formats are able to optionally omit any or all the above features.
Feature names may be abbreviated like command line option names.
.RE
.TP 8n
.B \-DISable\fP \f[I]feature-name\fP
This option is used to disable the output of a named feature.
See the \fB\-enable\fP option for a description of the available features.
.TP 8n
\fB\-IGnore_Checksums\fP
.so man/man1/o_ignore_checksums.so
.so man/man1/o_sequence.so
.TP 8n
.B \-CRLF
This option is short-hand for the \fB\-line-termination=crlf\fP option.
For use with harebrained EPROM programmer devices which assume all the
world uses Evil Bill's operating system's line termination.
.TP
\fB\-Line_Termination \f[I]style-name\fP
.RS
This option may be used to specify line termination style for text
output.  The default is to use the host operating system's default line
termination style (but Cygwin behaves as if it's Unix).  Use this option with
caution, because it will also introduce extra (i.e. wrong) CR bytes into
binary formats.
.TP 4n
Carriage_Return_Line_Feed
Use the CRLF line termination style, typical of DOS and M$ Windows.
.TP 4n
NewLine
Use the NL line termination style, typical of Unix and Linux.
.TP 4n
Carriage_Return
Use the CR line termination style, typical of Apple Macintosh.
.PP
All other line termination style names will produce a fatal error.
Style names may be abbreviated like command line option names.
.RE
.TP 8n
\fB\-Line_Length\fP \f[I]number\fP
This option may be used to limit the length of the output lines to at
most \f[I]number\fP characters.  (Not meaningful for binary file format.)
Defaults to something less than 80 characters, depending on the format.
.TP 8n
\fB\-HEAder\fP \f[I]string\fP
This option may be used to set the header comment,
in those formats which support it.
This option implies the \fB\-enable=header\fP option.
.TP 8n
\fB\-Execution_Start_Address\fP \f[I]number\fP
.RS
This option may be used to set the execution start address,
in those formats which support it.
The execution start address is where the monitor will jump to and start
executing code once the hex file has finished loading,
think of it as a \[lq]goto\[rq] address.
Usually ignored by EPROM programmer devices.
This option implies the \fB\-enable=exec-start-addr\fP option.
.PP
Please note: the execution start address is a different concept than the
first address in memory of your data.  If you want to change where your
data starts in memory, use the \fB\-offset\fP filter.
